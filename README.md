 MY-WEBSITE
************

This site serves as an online portfolio/CV for me, Andrew Grant Sheppard.
It is my first "built-from-scratch" website.  It has been a learning tool for me, and I hope to use it as proof of my skills and abilities I have learned and will learn.
This website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
