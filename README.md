# my-website
My first built-from-scratch website.  It has served as a learning tool for front-end development, as well as proof of my abilities.
The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
As I continue learning, I will update this site.
When I start learning and building the back-end, I'm not sure if this site can stay here or if I will need to copy it to another service.  If back-end hosting services require the front-end site files to be located in the same directory as the back-end files, I will code a new website and add a link to it on this site.
