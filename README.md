 MY-WEBSITE
************

This is my first built-from-scratch website.  It has served as a learning tool for front-end development, and hope to use it as proof of the skills and abilities I have learned and will learn.
The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
As I continue learning, I will update this site.
When I start learning and building the back-end, I'm not sure if this site can stay here or if I will need to copy it to another service.  If back-end hosting services require the front-end site files to be located in the same directory as the back-end files, I will code a new website and add a link to it on this site.

Whatever the case may turn out to be regarding the above mentioned, as well as any future developments, I intend that this site's codebase to be the backbone of a new web presence for me as a self-directed fullstack learner and, eventually, a out-and-out fullstack developer/engineer.
